<td colspan="2"><p>Technically, mechanical engineering is the application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering from design to manufacturing to the marketplace for any object. Mechanical engineers analyze their work using the principles
                of motion, energy, and force—ensuring that designs function safely, efficiently, and reliably, all at a competitive cost.
            </p><br>
            <p>Mechanical engineers make a difference. That's because mechanical engineering careers center on creating technologies to meet human needs. Virtually every product or service in modern life has probably been touched in some way by a mechanical
                engineer to help humankind.</p><br>
            <p>Being ingrained in many challenges and innovations across many fields means a mechanical engineering education is versatile. To meet this broad demand, mechanical engineers may design a component, a machine, a system, or a process. This ranges
                from the macro to the micro, from the largest systems like cars and satellites to the smallest components like sensors and switches. Anything that needs to be manufactured—indeed, anything with moving parts—needs the expertise of a mechanical
                engineer. Become a mechanical engineer..</p><br>
			<h3>What do mechanical engineers do?</h3>
            <p>

                Mechanical engineering combines creativity, knowledge and analytical tools to complete the difficult task of shaping an idea into reality. This transformation happens at the personal scale, affecting human lives on a level we can reach out and touch like
                robotic prostheses. It happens on the local scale, affecting people in community-level spaces, like with agile interconnected microgrids. And it happens on bigger scales, like with advanced power systems, through engineering that operates
                nationwide or across the globe. <br>Mechanical engineers have an enormous range of opportunity and their education mirrors this breadth of subjects. Students concentrate on one area while strengthening analytical and problem-solving
                skills applicable to any engineering situation.

		<h2>  Scop of Mechanical Engineering</h2><br>
		<p><b>Automation Engineer</b></p><br>
		<p>Automation engineers design, build and maintain self-operating machines and processes. They work closely with clients to understand the process or task being automated. An automation engineer then designs, tests, programs and maintains
                    the machine or system. <br>Automation engineers need to stay up to date on safety and health regulations, including sanitation and how close the automated systems will be to people. These tasks often require precise motions and careful
                    timing. Automation engineers often work in the manufacturing and food processing industries, where robots are used on the assembly line to perform specific tasks. </p>

		<h2>Research and Development Engineering</h2><br>
		<p> Research and development engineers build new manufacturing methods and products. They also improve existing systems to increase productivity, safety and efficiency. They build concept designs, test prototypes and help take new methods
                    and products to market. Research and development engineers need to be innovative and analytical to recognize problems and find solutions. They work in a deadline-driven environment and need to be able to work both independently and
                    with a team.</p>

	<h2>Instrumentation Engineer </h2><br>
	<p>Instrumentation engineers specialize in equipment that monitors and controls engineering systems. They design, build, test, install, manage and maintain equipment that ensures other engineering systems work correctly. They need to understand
                    how many systems work together, how and where to measure acceptable ranges and stay current on changing health and safety regulations.</p>

		<h2>Senior Design Engineer </h2><br>
		<p>Senior design engineers specialize in creating new products. They usually lead a team from the beginning of the project through production. Senior design engineers often act as project managers by working with customers to understand their
                    goals and requirements, developing a schedule and budget, leading the team through the design process and working to improve processes for future projects. They need to be able to assess and communicate risk, understand high-level
                    design processes and lead product testing.</p></td>

	<h2>Powertrain Engineer</h2><br>
	<p> Powertrain engineers are mechanical engineers that work in the automotive industry. They improve the appearance and performance of engines, the powertrain, electrical components and software in modern vehicles. Powertrain engineers might
                    work with motorcycles, cars and commercial vehicles, like box trucks and semi-trucks. They work closely with clients to meet their goals and answer any questions they have.</p>
