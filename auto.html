<td colspan="2">  <p>Automobile or Automotive Engineering has gained recognition and importance ever since motor vehicles capable for transporting passengers has been in vogue. Now due to the rapid growth of auto component manufacturers and automobile industries,
                there is a great demand for Automobile Engineers. Automobile Engineering alias Automotive Engineering or Vehicle Engineering is one of the most challenging careers in the field of engineering with a wide scope.
            </p>
            <p>This branch deals with the designing, developing, manufacturing, testing and repairing and servicing automobiles such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, scooters etc & the related sub Engineering systems. For the perfect blend of manufacturing
                and designing automobiles, Automobile Engineering uses the features of different elements of Engineering such as mechanical, electrical, electronic, software and safety engineering.</p>
            <p>The major task of an Automobile Engineer is the designing, developing, manufacturing and testing of vehicles from the concept stage to the production stage.....</p>
            <p>The work of automobile engineer is usually categorized into three categories:
                <li>Design</li>
                <li>Research Devlopment</li>
                <li>Production</li>

		<h2>Job Functions</h2><br>
		<p><b>Development engineer</b></p><br>
		<p>A development engineer has the responsibility for coordinating delivery of the engineering attributes of a complete automobile (bus, car, truck, van, SUV, motorcycle etc.) as dictated by the automobile manufacturer, governmental regulations,
                    and the customer who buys the product.
                    <br>Much like the Systems engineer, the development engineer is concerned with the interactions of all systems in the complete automobile. While there are multiple components and systems in an automobile that have to function as designed,
                    they must also work in harmony with the complete automobile. As an example, the brake system's main function is to provide braking functionality to the automobile. Along with this, it must also provide an acceptable level of: pedal
                    feel (spongy, stiff), brake system “noise” (squeal, shudder, etc.), and interaction with the ABS (anti-lock braking system) </p>

		<h2>  Manufacturing engineer</h2><br>
		<p>Manufacturing engineers are responsible for ensuring proper production of the automotive components or complete vehicles. While the development engineers are responsible for the function of the vehicle, manufacturing engineers are responsible
                    for the safe and effective production of the vehicle. This group of engineers consist of process engineers, logistic coordinators, tooling engineers, robotics engineers, and assembly planners.</p>

	<h2>Design engineer</h2><br>
	<p>Automobiles must be designed in a way that they should be more efficient in terms of speed, fuel usage, safety of passengers and obviously more attractive. Today’s cars and other automobiles must also carry connectivity options with the
                    other world which needs knowledge of computer science engineering. So, an automobile is designed keeping so many factors in mind.
