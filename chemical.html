				<strong> Chemical engineering </strong>is all about changing raw materials into useful products such as clothes, food and drink, and energy. Chemical engineers focus on processes and products – they develop and design processes to create products;
                either focussing on improving existing processes or creating new ones. This means that they are also concerned with managing resources, protecting the environment and health and safety. Chemical engineers are sometimes called ‘universal
                engineers’ because it is such a broad discipline - they are essentially concerned with transforming one thing into another. <br> <br>
                <strong>What does a chemical engineer do?</strong><br> Chemical engineers develop and design chemical manufacturing processes. Chemical engineers apply the principles of chemistry, biology, physics, and math to solve problems that involve
                the production or use of chemicals, fuel, drugs, food, and many other products

		<h2>The Scop of Chemical Engineering</h2><br>
		<p><b>Mining Engineer</b></p><br>
		<p>Although many people think that mining engineering is only for geological engineers, there are actually plenty of opportunities for chemical engineers in the industry too. The expertise that chemical engineering graduates have is needed
                    to manage and optimize processes, equipment, and product quality, such as when raw ore is broken into smaller pieces during the milling process. Mining engineers usually go into mines a lot instead of staying in the office, so as a
                    mining engineer, you might even go underground! Certainly not for those with claustrophobia. </p>

		<h2>  Food Engineer .</h2><br>
		<p>Food engineers work to process, produce, store, and distribute fo4ds that you eat every day. They may work to design a food production line so that more food can be produced at a lower cost. They may help to refine the production process
                    so that a food’s taste or texture changes. And sometimes they are tasked with making sure that food is properly packaged and that food quality is up to par. So, yes, there is a lot that a food engineer may be responsible for! Many
                    food engineers use knowledge taken directly from chemical engineering curriculum to do their work, making chemical engineering graduates ideal candidates for this role. .</p>

	<h2>Water Treatment Engineer</h2><br>
	<p>Water is one of the planet’s most important resources. Besides being used for drinking, water is used in agriculture, manufacturing, and thousands of other industries. As such, it needs to be protected and managed now so that it can be
                    enjoyed by future generations. Water that people use for drinking can come from a contaminated reservoir, requiring treatment before it can be consumed. Contaminated water produced by the resource extraction industries needs to be
                    dealt with before it can be disposed of. The list goes on. Chemical engineering graduates fit perfectly in the water treatment industry. While studying chemical engineering, they may receive training in process engineering, biochemistry,
                    and waste treatment, all of which are in demand in the water treatment industry.

		<h2>Production Engineer</h2><br>
		<p>Many production processes have a lot of moving parts, and when something goes wrong, the process can grind to a halt. Production engineers are responsible for monitoring equipment and production processes, and troubleshooting any problems
                    that may come up. . Much like process engineers, they may also work to find ways to improve and optimize processes.
                    <br>Chemical engineering graduates are well suited to production engineering because, as part of any chemical engineering degree, students must intimately know the ins and outs of a process, how to design equipment, how to improve
                    a process, and how to solve problems.!</p>

	<h2> Pharmaceutical Engineer</h2><br>
	<p>With a growing, aging population and new ailments always popping up, the pharmaceutical industry is never short of work. As a pharmaceutical engineer, you might be tasked with conceiving pharmaceuticals, designing or scaling up production
                    processes, or manufacturing, labelling, and packing pharmaceuticals. This career path is best suited to those who are especially interested in biochemistry, manufacturing, and research and development. There is a lot of opportunity
                    for a chemical engineering graduate to become a pharmaceutical engineer!
