<h1>Civil Engineering:-</h1>

<td colspan="2"><p>Civil engineering is arguably the oldest engineering discipline. It deals with the built environment and can be dated to the first time someone placed a roof over his or her head or laid a tree trunk across a river to make it easier to get
                across.
        </p>
		<br>
		<p>
		The built environment encompasses much of what defines modern civilization. Buildings and bridges are often the first constructions that come to mind, as they are the most conspicuous creations of structural engineering, one of civil engineering's
                major sub-disciplines. Roads, railroads, subway systems, and airports are designed by transportation engineers, another category of civil engineering. And then there are the less visible creations of civil engineers. Every time you open
                a water faucet, you expect water to come out, without thinking that civil engineers made it possible. New York City has one of the worldâ€™s most impressive water supply systems, receiving billions of gallons of high-quality water from the
                Catskills over one hundred miles away. Similarly, not many people seem to worry about what happens to the water after it has served its purposes. The old civil engineering discipline of sanitary engineering has evolved into modern environmental
                engineering of such significance that most academic departments have changed their names to civil and environmental engineering.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Civil engineering is an <strong> exciting profession</strong> because at the end of the day you can see the results of your work, whether this is a completed bridge, a high-rise building, a subway station, or a hydroelectric dam.

		<p><b> Project Manager</b></p><br>
		<p>Civil project managers, often referred to as construction project managers, are primarily responsible for overseeing the building of large construction projects, such as commercial structures, roadways, and bridges.

                    <br> They are involved in the areas of pre-planning, budgeting, resource allocation, contract negotiation, and worker coordination. Civil project managers might supervise construction site personnel and subcontractors, attend weekly
                    project progress meetings, and monitor compliance with building and safety codes and regulations.</p>

		<h2> Site Manager</h2><br>
		<p>Site engineering is a branch of engineering concerned with the administration and quality control of construction projects. Site engineers may oversee construction projects at different stages, from design to completion. By understanding
                    the site engineer's responsibilities and job duties, you can decide whether you want to pursue this profession. In this article, we discuss what is site engineering, understand what a site engineer does, look at the required skills
                    and find out how to become one.</p>

	<h2>CAD Technician </h2><br>
	<p>A CAD technician, generally known as a draughtsman, uses CAD software to create technical drawings and plans for products and parts used in the engineering, construction, and manufacturing industries. CAD technicians work with architects
                    and design engineers to understand the requirements of their initial designs and turn them into accurate and detailed technical drawings in 2D and 3D models .</p>

		<h2>Structural Engineer </h2><br>
		<p>Structural engineering is the <strong> field of engineering that deals with the structural integrity and strength of a building or structure.</strong> Structural engineering is a specialty of civil engineering that ensures the structures
                    are safe, stable and don't collapse under applied loads.</p>
